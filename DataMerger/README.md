# LabTools_DataMerger
A tool for merging data from multiple excel spreadsheets


I designed this Shiny app for use within our lab. Its function is pretty straightforward. The app will scan the chosen folder for any files ending in ".xlsx" (this can easily be changed to .csv or any other sort of file extension that might hold data). It then merges the data together so it can then be exported as either a csv or excel file. I also included the ability to edit individual cells, delete rows, and replace missing values with "Undet" (for undetectable) as this is a common thing we need to do in our lab.

This is part of a package of tools to ensure better data management and integrity.
