# LabTools_DataExplorer

This is the second tool I have developed to ensure better data management and integrity within our lab.

The function of this app is to merge cleaned data and to act as a Data Explorer that allows the user to search and sort data. It will read csv files contained in a directory and merge them. This app is specific to our lab so "Sample_ID", "Study", and "Type" are mandatory columns that need to exist across all datasets being merged. Replacing "Undet" is another function that is specific to our lab. These features are easily changed if you know a little bit of R.
